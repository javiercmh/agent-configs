# Global Configuration

## Coding Guidelines
* **Follow best practices**: Follow widely accepted conventions specific to the programming language in use.
* **Standard libraries**: Prefer built-in functions and avoid third-party dependencies unless they are the industry standard.
* **Dependency Isolation**: Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies. Ensure the environment is activated for all task-related executions.

### Python
* **Deep learning**: Prefer `torch` to `tensorflow`.
* **Environment name**: Use `.venv` for the virtual environment directory.
